# SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
The repository contains the project for Intelligent Systems for the Internet carried out by Chiara Romanelli, Federico Pasqui, and Milena Senna, students of Computer Engineering at the University of RomaTre.

Our work involved analyzing tweets related to the U.S. elections, focusing on the years 2019 and 2021. The purpose of our analysis was to study the polarization of tweets through the examination of various topics. Specifically, we conducted a sentiment analysis to show citizens' preferences for the two candidates: Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Another topic we considered was the localization of the users of the relevant tweets, allowing us to observe sentiment trends on a geographical basis.
